# CEF444_Group1_time-series-forecast

This repository serves as a workspace dedicated to implementing a robust time-series forecasting system for crucial weather conditions, specifically **solar irradiance**, across several key towns in Cameroon. Accurate irradiance forecasting is vital for optimizing solar energy systems, agricultural planning, and general environmental monitoring.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Background

Solar energy is a promising renewable resource, but its variability poses challenges for integration into existing energy grids. Accurate forecasting of solar irradiance (a measure of solar power available at a given location) is essential for efficient energy management, grid stability, and maximizing the utility of solar installations. This project aims to address this need by developing and evaluating time-series models for irradiance prediction in selected Cameroonian towns.

## ðŸŽ¯ Context and Purpose

The project focuses on building predictive models for solar irradiance in Bafoussam, Bambili, Bamenda, and Yaounde. By leveraging historical weather data, we aim to develop models that can accurately forecast future irradiance levels, thereby supporting better decision-making in solar energy deployment and related sectors.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1.  **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** To gather raw weather data and perform thorough cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To understand the underlying patterns, trends, seasonality, and correlations within the dataset.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** To create new, relevant features from existing data to enhance model performance.
4.  **Model Development:** To implement and train advanced time-series forecasting models (Prophet and SARIMAX).
5.  **Model Evaluation:** To rigorously assess the performance of the developed models against established baselines using standard metrics.
6.  **Visualization & Reporting:** To clearly present model results, insights, and conclusions through comprehensive visualizations and reports.
